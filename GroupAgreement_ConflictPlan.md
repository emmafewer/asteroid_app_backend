## Group Agreement and Conflict Plan

# Are you working after hours?
No working after hours on Tuesdays, but other days yes. Follow the timeline on the project guidelines and if we meet/exceed that day’s work we don’t need to work after hours. Can work separately.

# How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? 
We’ll discuss at the end of the day if we need to work after hours.

# What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard? 
We will both listen and consider each other’s ideas

# How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 
There’s only two of us. All ideas are welcome.

## Github workflow

# Should we have a separate backend?
We will keep it separate since the rails backend is an api, and it is best practice.

# Are you working on branches?
Yes, we will have a branch for each feature 

# Making pull requests
We will each make a pull request whenever we want to merge our branch to master - whenever the branch is finished.

# Do you want to have all code reviewed before it gets pushed to master?
Yes, the other partner will review the code and merge it.

# Are you using slack
Yes

# Are you using github projects or trello to communicate who is working on what feature
We will use trello.
